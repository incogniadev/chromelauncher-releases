# ChromeLauncher Releases

Public distribution repository for ChromeLauncher binaries.

## ⚠️ Important

**This repository is automatically managed** by GitHub Actions from the private source repository.

**ONLY download `.exe` files from GitHub Releases** - ignore "Source code" archives (they don't contain application source code, only repository metadata).

## Download

### Official Releases

All binaries are distributed via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/incogniadev/chromelauncher-releases/releases).

**⚠️ Important**: The "Source code (zip)" and "Source code (tar.gz)" files are automatically generated by GitHub and contain only repository files (README, .gitattributes). **They do NOT contain the ChromeLauncher application source code**. Only download the `.exe` files.

2. Download the appropriate `.exe` file for your location
3. Ignore the "Source code" archives

$actualHash = (Get-FileHash .\ChromeLauncher-142-Victoria-PROD.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
if ($actualHash -eq $expectedHash) {
    Write-Host "Checksum verified" -ForegroundColor Green
